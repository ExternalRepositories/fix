## July 26th, 2021: Fighting Jekyll

### [Install Jekyll](https://github.com/arnemertz/fix/commit/b950b058031d5c711e8d8cdc0cebd286f6bb43bd)

I installed Jekyll yet again, fought a few things I overlooked before, but it still won't work. I'll leave it as it is for now and open an issue on one of the theme pages as I followed their documentation to the letter. I'll still have to figure out how to structure the GitHub page, so it might take some time until there's more than an empty page. It's a bit frustrating.


## July 27th, 2021: Configuring Jekyll

Somehow I still get lured back into setting up the documentation.

### [Configure Jekyll and add about page](https://github.com/arnemertz/fix/commit/d7685ad19b36a7c7b7039362f9ed0f03de722ed1)

The Jekyll page is now configured to use the Minima theme again, so I can at least preview it locally. On GitHub it still looks bad (no styles, no images), but it's more than an empty page. The links to the diary posts don't work yet. There's still work to do, but frankly, I wanted to do something else than building the docs this week.

I also edited the about page to tell readers what the project is about. The page will also be published on the blog.

## July 29th, 2021: Copy Pasta

### [Take over Jekyll structure from example project](https://github.com/arnemertz/fix/commit/e084f065ccb46accf19075870a3783966e9b844f)

I gave up configuring and breaking things on my own for now and basically took over the structure of a [Jekyll starter project on GitHub](https://github.com/jsanz/gh-pages-minima-starter). Ready to start actual work on the project.
