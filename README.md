# Fix

A lightweight issue tracker.

For more on the project check the posts about it on my blog: http://arne-mertz.de/category/fix/

In the current state I won't accept pull requests and issues - obviously.


## Dependencies

See the conanfile.txt for dependencies managed by Conan.

The acceptance test suite needs some python installations additional to conan:

    pip install behave
    pip install pathlib
