# Fix

A lightweight issue tracker. At least that's the idea.

This is going to be a project for me to learn and practice techniques, libraries, tools, etc.

I will blog along and write a developer diary.
See http://arne-mertz.de/category/fix/ for more info.

In the current state I won't accept pull requests and issues.
